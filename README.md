## 📖 Project Overview

This project applies **advanced machine learning algorithms**—including **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Stacking Classifier**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**—to enhance cybersecurity threat detection. The framework integrates multiple techniques to improve accuracy, robustness, and interpretability for threat identification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data preprocessing** & feature extraction
- Supervised learning with RF, SVM, Stacking, and CNN
- Model evaluation: precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy
- Visualization: correlation heatmaps, boxplots, summary statistics
- Outlier detection using Z-score method
- Scalable to diverse cybersecurity datasets

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy tensorflow
```

---

## 📂 Usage

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-threat-detection.git
   cd cybersecurity-threat-detection
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset (CSV or similar).

3. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to:

   * Load and preprocess data
   * Train and evaluate ML models
   * Visualize results and insights

4. Example to train Random Forest:

   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

   rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
   rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
   ```

---

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

* Feature correlation heatmaps
* Boxplots for outlier detection
* Performance metrics summaries
* Time-based trend analysis (if timestamp data available)

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Recommendations

* Ensure balanced classes to avoid training errors.
* Tune hyperparameters for improved results.
* CNN requires proper input reshaping for feature tensors.
* Some warnings on metrics may occur if classes are imbalanced; handle accordingly.
